Even after struggling to get into the game for the better part of it, the Zambians eventually found their rhythm to put half a dozen past Angola to set up what should be a comfortable return leg when the two sides meet again in Zambia.

Lushomo Mweemba found the opener in the 40th minute, a goal that subsequently opened the floodgates wide open as 2023 CAF Women Player of the year nominee, Barbara Banda showed her class with a stunning hat-trick before Ireene Lungu and Rachel Kundananji sealed the victory for the Copper Queens.

      </h4>
      <p>
      Aston Villa overran Manchester City with a fully-deserved 1-0 win on Wednesday thanks to a deflected shot from Leon Bailey, leaving the reigning Premier League champions in an unfamiliar fourth position and six points off the top.

Unai Emery's hungry and confident Villa, enjoying their best season for years, dominated the game from start to finish, leap-frogging City to third in the table.

After squandering a hatful of chances, Villa's winner came in the 74th minute when the pacey Bailey took the ball just past the halfway line, ran at City's defence and unleashed a shot that hit Ruben Dias' foot to beat goalkeeper Ederson.
      </p>
      
      
      <p> 

        Minutes later, Douglas Luiz struck the post for the hosts, who could have won by a larger margin in a surprisingly one-sided game, to the noisy delight of the majority at Villa Park.

"It was a great game, great night for the fans, great night for Aston Villa," said Bailey. "To get the win and to be the one that scored the goal is a magnificent feeling."

The result left Pep Guardiola's team on 30 points after 15 games - six points behind leaders Arsenal - and without a win in their last four Premier League matches.
      </p>

      <p> 
        Aston Villa moved up to third on 32 points, two behind Liverpool and four behind Arsenal, after what was their 14th consecutive home Premier League victory.

      Such was their dominance that Villa's 22 shots were the joint-most faced by a Guardiola team in 535 games managing in Europe's big five leagues. City's mere two shots were the fewest ever registered by a Guardiola team in those leagues.

      <h4 class="heading-4"> According to report, golf is more dangerous than rugby</h4>
      <p>
        Compared to its sporting brethren, golf is not considered a hazardous game. One has to be on the lookout for 
        errant tee shots, sure, or sun exposure. But it beats the brutality of football and hockey, or having a fastball 
        fired at your head.

At least, that was the consensus.<br>

According to Golf Support, which has analyzed several reports on sports-related injuries, golf is more dangerous than
contact sports like rugby and hockey. A 2016 paper from the National Health Statistics Report, which investigated over 8.6 million reported recreational injuries, states that golf—which was grouped with tennis, badminton and bowling—had a rate of 1.8 injuries for every 1,000 persons. Though that was behind figures from general exercise (5.3), basketball (3.3) and football (3.1), it was still a higher percentage than rugby and hockey (1.5), 
baseball (1.6) and, oddly enough, combative sports (1.2).
      </p>

      <p>                 
        Additionally, the British Journal of Sports Medicine revealed that 15.8 to 40.9 percent of amateur golfers suffer an
         injury on an annual basis. 
        Lower back ailments (15.2 to 34 percent) are the main culprits.

Now, before you take your child out of golf lessons in favor of the rugby pitch, take these findings with a grain of salt. <br>
Golf is paired with several other sports—meaning its singular injury rate could be a fraction of football and hockey. Moreover, far be it from us to call shenanigans on a journal of medicine...but the BJSM's injury range for annual professional golf injuries is 31 to 90 percent. That's, um, a pretty big window.

Of course, as I write this, I'm rubbing my elbow, sore from a range session that occurred five days ago, so maybe we're not the ones to be casting aspersions.

      <h4 class="heading-4">  <i>"Patson Daka keeps raising the bar </i>
      </h4>
      <p> 
        LEICESTER City Coach Enzo Maresca has said he did not expect striker Patson Daka
         to play well on Saturday having not seen much game time this season.<br>
         Daka served his manager a pie.Daka was finally named in the starting line up by Enzo Maresca after explaining his lack of game time prior to today. 

          Daka scored the second goal if the game before setting up Wilfred Ndidi for the fourth to seal a well deserved win. 

             Stephy Mavididi’s 14th-minute penalty put City on course for victory, although Enzo Maresca’s men had to ride a mild storm at the end of the first half to preserve a clean sheet on Filbert Way. 
      </p>

      <p> 


Patson Daka’s maiden goal of the season, on his first 2023/24 league start, doubled the advantage, before a second from Mavididi and Wilfred Ndidi’s stylish finish – three goals in 10 minutes at the start of the second period – saw Leicester’s quality come to the fore. 

Daka put in a 63rd minute shift before being replaced by  Thomas Cannon. 

The Foxes remain top of the pile in the second tier, still a point clear of Ipswich Town and eight ahead of third-placed Leeds United. 

They have 49 points after 20 matches, winning 16 of 20, with a goal difference of +26, 10 better than any other side.
