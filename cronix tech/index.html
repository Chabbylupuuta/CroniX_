            <p>Did you know that the first computer virus was created in 1983 and was called the "Elk Cloner"? 
              It infected Apple II computers through floppy disks and displayed a humorous poem.</p>

          <div class="card2">
            <p>Did you know that the concept of cloud computing dates back to the 1960s? It was first introduced by J.C.R. Licklider, 
              who envisioned a global interconnected network of computers that would allow users to access data and programs from anywhere</p>
          </div>

          <div class="card2">
            <p>Did you know that the term "Wi-Fi" doesn't actually stand for anything? It's simply a brand name coined by a marketing agency.

          <div class="card2">
            <p>Did you know that the first mobile phone call was made on April 3, 1973, by Motorola engineer Martin Cooper? 
              He called his rival at Bell Labs and told him he was speaking from a "real cellular telephone." The phone he used weighed about 2.5 pounds!.</p>

          <div class="card2">
            <p>Did you know that the first webcam was created at the University of Cambridge to monitor a coffee pot? In 1991, researchers set up a camera to

          <div class="card2">
            <p>Did you know that the QWERTY keyboard layout was designed in the 1870s to prevent jamming on mechanical typewriters? The layout was strategically 
              arranged to slow down typing and prevent commonly used letter pairs from being struck in quick succession, thereby reducing the likelihood of jams.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="card2">
            <p>Did you know that the term "hackathon" is a portmanteau of "hack" and "marathon"? It refers to an event where programmers, developers, and designers 
              collaborate intensively on software projects over a short period, usually 24 to 48 hours, to create innovative solutions or prototypes</p>

            <p>Did you know that the Apollo 11 guidance computer, which helped navigate the spacecraft to the Moon and back, had less processing power than a modern smartphone? 
              Despite its limited capabilities, it successfully executed complex calculations and played a crucial role in the success of the Apollo mission</p>
